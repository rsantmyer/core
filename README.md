# core

core is an Oracle PL/SQL framework for database application deployment,
versioning, dependency management, and lifecycle tracking.

It provides infrastructure for building composable, semantically-versioned
database applications with deployment provenance, metadata ownership,
dependency tracking, and operational tooling.

## Features

### Deployment & Lifecycle Management
- `pkg_application`
  - application registration
  - semantic version tracking
  - deployment lifecycle management
  - dependency management
  - object registration
  - deployment provenance tracking via git commit hash
  - uninstall and cleanup support

### Operational Tooling
- `pkg_syslog`
  - generic logging utility inspired by UNIX syslog

- `pkg_trace`
  - lightweight tracing facility for runtime diagnostics and troubleshooting

### Metadata & Dictionary Services
- `pkg_app_dict`
  - generic application dictionary framework

### Development Utilities
- `assert`
  - design-by-contract style assertion procedure

- `num_tab`
  - reusable numeric collection type for passing arrays of numbers

## Core Concepts

### Semantic Versioned Database Applications

Applications are deployed using semantic version metadata:

- major
- minor
- patch
- pre-release
- build metadata

This allows database applications to evolve in a controlled and traceable way.

### Deployment Provenance

Deployments may optionally record the full 40-character git commit hash
associated with the deployed source state.

This allows environments running the same semantic version to still be
distinguished during active development, hotfixes, or unreleased builds.

### Dependency-Aware Applications

Applications can declare dependencies on:
- other applications
- required system privileges
- required database objects

This helps validate deployment prerequisites and application compatibility.

### Cross-Application Metadata Ownership

Applications may register ownership of rows stored in tables owned by
other applications, enabling automatic cleanup during uninstall.

## Example Deployment

```sql
BEGIN
    pkg_application.begin_deployment_p(
        ip_application_name   => 'MYAPP',
        ip_major_version      => 1,
        ip_minor_version      => 0,
        ip_patch_version      => 0,
        ip_pre_release        => 'beta.1',
        ip_deploy_commit_hash => 'a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcd',
        ip_notes              => 'Initial deployment of MYAPP'
    );
END;
/
```

Applications may then:
- register deployed objects
- register dependencies
- seed metadata
- mark the deployment complete

## Uninstalling core

This repository includes:

`Deployment_Manifests/uninstall.core.sql`

a self-contained uninstall script for the `core` deployment.

- It drops the objects created by `deploy.core.full.sql`
- It does not rely on `APP_OBJECTS` or `pkg_application` metadata being populated
- It prompts for confirmation before proceeding

> [!WARNING]
> `uninstall.core.sql` is destructive and intended only for safe,
> non-production environments.

## Cross-Application Metadata Ownership

A key feature of `pkg_application` is the ability to register metadata
that belongs to one application but lives in a table owned by another.

This ensures automatic cleanup when `delete_application_p` is called,
with no orphaned rows left behind.

### The problem it solves

Applications frequently seed rows into shared tables owned by other
applications.

For example:
- `MYAPP` inserts rows into `app_dictionary`
- `app_dictionary` is owned by `core`

Without ownership tracking, those rows become orphaned when `MYAPP`
is later removed.

### How it works

`add_object_metadata_p` records:
- the target table name
- a discriminator column
- a discriminator value

Together, these identify the rows owned by the registering application.

When `delete_application_p` is called, `core` loops through all
registered metadata and executes:

```sql
DELETE FROM <table>
WHERE <discriminator_col> = <discriminator_val>;
```

### Usage example

```sql
-- MYAPP deployment: seed reference data into another app's table
INSERT INTO product_category (
    owning_app,
    category_code,
    description
)
VALUES (
    'MYAPP',
    'WIDGET',
    'Widget category'
);

-- Register those rows for automatic cleanup
EXEC pkg_application.add_object_metadata_p(
       ip_application_name  => 'MYAPP',
       ip_object_name       => 'PRODUCT_CATEGORY',
       ip_object_type       => pkg_application.c_object_type_table,
       ip_discriminator_col => 'OWNING_APP',
       ip_discriminator_val => 'MYAPP');

-- Later: removing MYAPP automatically deletes its rows
EXEC pkg_application.delete_application_p(
       ip_application_name => 'MYAPP');
```

### Custom cleanup with dml_override_proc

When a plain `DELETE` is not sufficient — for example, when an
application creates dynamic database objects such as:
- queues
- sequences
- subsidiary tables

keyed by a discriminator value, the `ip_dml_override_proc`
parameter names a procedure to call instead of the default `DELETE`.

The procedure is invoked as:

```sql
BEGIN <proc_name>; END;
```

and is responsible for all cleanup.

```sql
-- MYAPP creates a private queue at deploy time
EXEC pkg_application.add_object_metadata_p(
       ip_application_name  => 'MYAPP',
       ip_object_name       => 'APP_OBJECTS',
       ip_object_type       => pkg_application.c_object_type_table,
       ip_discriminator_col => 'APPLICATION_NAME',
       ip_discriminator_val => 'MYAPP',
       ip_dml_override_proc => 'myapp_cleanup.drop_private_queue_p');
```
