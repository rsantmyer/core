# Deployment Orchestration

## Overview

While each database application is independently deployable, real-world
systems are typically composed of multiple cooperating applications.

For example:

```text
Database/
├── core/
├── job_control/
├── utl_interval/
├── yaxform/
├── my_app/
└── Orchestration/
```

In this model:

- each application owns its own deployment manifests
- applications evolve independently
- applications may declare dependencies on other applications
- orchestration coordinates deployment order and provenance tracking

This approach treats database systems as composable software systems
rather than monolithic schema deployments.

---

## Design Philosophy

The orchestration layer is intentionally lightweight.

Responsibilities are separated as follows:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Application repository | Owns database objects and deployment manifests |
| `pkg_application` | Tracks versions, dependencies, and deployment metadata |
| Orchestration layer | Coordinates deployment order and injects deployment provenance |
| Git | Provides immutable source provenance |

This separation allows:
- independent versioning
- reproducible deployments
- partial upgrades
- environment promotion
- dependency-aware evolution
- exact source traceability

---

## Recommended Structure

A typical multi-application deployment layout:

```text
Database/
├── core/
├── job_control/
├── utl_interval/
├── yaxform/
├── my_app/
└── Orchestration/
    ├── setenv.sh
    ├── env.sql
    └── deploy_full.sql
```

### Application Directories

Each application repository contains its own:
- deployment manifests
- schema objects
- metadata
- package specifications and bodies
- uninstall scripts (well, if deployed correctly, CORE can handle this)

For example:

```text
core/
├── Deployment_Manifests/
├── Packages/
├── Tables/
├── Types/
└── README.md
```

### Orchestration Directory

The orchestration directory coordinates deployment across applications.

Typical contents:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `setenv.sh` | Generates deployment provenance variables |
| `env.sql` | SQL*Plus substitution variables containing git commit hashes |
| `deploy_full.sql` | Top-level deployment wrapper |

---

## Deployment Provenance

One of the primary goals of orchestration is deployment provenance.

A deployment should record not only:
- which semantic version was deployed

but also:
- the exact git commit hash associated with the deployed source state
- the exact artifact URI, checksum, package coordinate, and build metadata

This allows:
- reproducible deployments
- environment comparison
- rollback analysis
- hotfix traceability
- auditing
- debugging of in-development versions

---

## Generating env.sql

A common pattern is to generate SQL*Plus substitution variables
containing the current git commit hash for each application.

Example `setenv.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

: > env.sql

for dir in ../*/; do
    name="$(basename "$dir")"

    if hash="$(git log -1 --pretty=format:%H -- "$dir" 2>/dev/null)" \
        && [[ -n "$hash" ]]; then

        var_name="$(printf '%s' "$name" \
            | tr '[:lower:]-' '[:upper:]_')"

        printf "DEFINE %s = %s\n" \
            "$var_name" \
            "$hash" \
            >> env.sql
    fi
done
```

Example generated `env.sql`:

```sql
DEFINE CORE = a8194d36446d202c19325b6c063e0c5047485ea8
DEFINE JOB_CONTROL = 5bbaf7a0f38e5d3e91ab15d7dcac53d924f12d44
DEFINE YAXFORM = 2f77c6f7e8f54138f0e4eb1d5d5fbd9dc7b48c6a
```

The full 40-character git hash is recommended.

---

## Top-Level Deployment Wrapper

The orchestration layer typically contains a top-level deployment wrapper.

Example:

```sql
@./env.sql

PROMPT =========================================================
PROMPT Deploying CORE
PROMPT =========================================================

@../core/Deployment_Manifests/deploy.core.full.sql &CORE

PROMPT =========================================================
PROMPT Deploying JOB_CONTROL
PROMPT =========================================================

@../job_control/Deployment_Manifests/deploy.job_control.full.sql &JOB_CONTROL

PROMPT =========================================================
PROMPT Deploying YAXFORM
PROMPT =========================================================

@../yaxform/Deployment_Manifests/deploy.yaxform.full.sql &YAXFORM
```

Each application deployment manifest receives the commit hash associated
with the deployed source state.

---

## Application Deployment Manifest

Application deployment manifests typically accept the git commit hash
as a parameter and pass it to `pkg_application.begin_deployment_p`.

Example:

```sql
DEFINE GIT_COMMIT_HASH=&1

BEGIN
    pkg_application.begin_deployment_p(
        ip_application_name   => 'CORE',
        ip_major_version      => 1,
        ip_minor_version      => 0,
        ip_patch_version      => 0,
        ip_deploy_commit_hash => '&GIT_COMMIT_HASH'
    );
END;
/
```

This records:
- semantic version
- deployment timestamp
- exact source provenance

inside the deployment registry.

For artifact-managed deployments, deployment tooling can call
`pkg_application.begin_artifact_deployment_p` instead. This keeps the
manual `begin_deployment_p` call small while allowing dbpm or other
orchestration tools to record the exact artifact that was resolved,
verified, and deployed.

Typical artifact provenance includes:
- artifact URI or local path
- artifact checksum and checksum algorithm
- exact ZIP file name
- package repository coordinate
- source repository and commit
- build id, build URL, build time, and JSON build metadata

Core records this in `APP_DEPLOY_PROVENANCE`; dbpm remains responsible
for resolving the artifact, verifying its checksum, and passing the
resolved values into Core.

---

## Dependency Ordering

Applications should generally be deployed in dependency order.

Example:

```text
core
  └── job_control
        └── yaxform
              └── my_app
```

The orchestration layer is responsible for enforcing deployment order.

Future tooling may automate dependency resolution directly from
`pkg_application` metadata.

---

## Why Not Store Orchestration in core?

The orchestration layer is intentionally external to `core`.

`core` is:
- a reusable database application framework

The orchestration layer is:
- environment-specific composition and deployment coordination

Keeping orchestration external allows:
- different environments
- different deployment ordering
- partial deployments
- independent application selection
- environment-specific wrappers

without modifying application repositories.

---

## Future Directions

The orchestration pattern described here is intentionally simple.

Possible future enhancements include:
- declarative environment manifests
- automated dependency resolution
- deployment validation
- environment diffing
- deployment rollback support
- CI/CD integration
- environment promotion workflows
- deployment visualization

Example future manifest concept:

```yaml
applications:
  core:
    version: 1.2.0
    commit: a8194d36446d202c19325b6c063e0c5047485ea8
    dependencies: []

  job_control:
    version: 1.0.0
    commit: 5bbaf7a0f38e5d3e91ab15d7dcac53d924f12d44
    dependencies:
      - application: core
        min_version: 1.2.0

  emmt_xform:
    version: 3.1.0
    commit: 2f77c6f7e8f54138f0e4eb1d5d5fbd9dc7b48c6a
    dependencies:
      - application: core
        min_version: 1.2.0
      - application: job_control
        min_version: 1.0.0
```

Such manifests could eventually drive:
- deployment generation
- validation
- reproducibility
- environment auditing
- transport-style promotion workflows
